This template is ready to use on the Oculus Quest and the HTC Vive Pro. It includes locomotion (action based), direct interactables (right), ray interactable (left), numerous objects (cabinet, door), and a lift. It also uses the idea of presence to trigger events.

Requires: Unity 6000.3.2f1 or later with XR Interaction Toolkit 3.0.4 or later.

Thanks to Another Creative Technologist, C-Through, ValemVR for their tutorials.
